# AirAware NodeRED configuration

This repository houses the flows for NodeRED, which facilitate the communication between the MQTT broker (Mosquito) and the PHP/Laravel webserver API.

This flow is automatically imported by the [setup script](https://github.com/airaware-iot/setup) when setting up a new AirAware Hub.
